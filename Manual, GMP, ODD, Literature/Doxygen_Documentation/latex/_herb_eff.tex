\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Herbicide effects can be calculated in 2 different ways\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item via a simple txt-\/file with each row containing effect for the specific year
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item txt file includes 6 different columns for the herbicide induced effects on\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item establishment
\item seedling biomass
\item seed mortality
\item resource allocation to reproduction
\item plant mortality
\item plant growth
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item via a dose response function
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item trait file includes traits for the E\+C50 and slope of the dose responses
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item dose responses can be calculated for\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item establishment
\item seedling biomass
\item seed mortalitiy (i.\+e. seed fertility)
\item seed production
\item plant mortality
\item plant growth
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item simulation parameter app\+\_\+rate gives the specific application rate
\item calculation of effect\+: app\+\_\+rate$^\wedge$slope/(app\+\_\+rate$^\wedge$slope + E\+C50$^\wedge$slope)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Independent of the way, effects are stored as effect profiles for each plant and seed individual effect profile which is part of the plant and seed characteristics.
