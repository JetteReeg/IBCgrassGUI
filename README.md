## Short discription
The IBC-grass GUI was developed to facilitate the use of the plant community model IBC-grass for herbicide risk assessments of non-target terrestrial plant communities in Central Europe.  Users are able to run simulations for various plant communities, which may differ in their species composition, environmental parameter settings and herbicide settings. Several different outputs can be generated on population as well as on community level.
Detailed information on the model can be found in the ODD-protocol and GMP document.

## Language
The IBCgrass model is written in C++(11) and needs to be compiled with g++.
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is written in R using the packages RGtk2, RGtk2Extras, data.table, reshape2, foreach, doParallel, ggplot2 and ggthemes.

## Requirements
To run the IBCgrass GUI, following software need to be installed on the local machines:
R 		https://www.r-project.org/ 
		R needs to be set as environmental variable (see Manual for further details).
		Following R packages will be installed during the set up process: RGtk2, RGtk2Extras, data.table, reshape2, foreach, doParallel, ggplot2 and ggthemes.

GTK		The R package RGtk2 depends on gtk. The installation of RGtk2 led to errors under Mac. In that case, GTK needs to be installed by hand. 

G++ compiler	e.g. MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

The software was tested on Windows 7, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04. With following version:

R		3.5.2
g++		4.8.1
RGtk2		2.20.35 (with gtk 2.22.1)
RGtk2Extras	0.6.1
data.table	1.12.0
reshape2	1.4.3
foreach		1.4.4
doParallel	1.0.14
ggplot2		3.1.0
ggthemes	4.0.1
